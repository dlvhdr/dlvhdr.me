Recently I realize I've accumulated quite a few packages and wanted to do some cleaning and organizing.

These are the ones I kept and find _useful._

## I Always Forget about

### Utilities

- artprint - I use this to switch artworks in neovim's start screen
	- `artprint --random -t "dlvhdr" --tc 5 --ac 4`
- curlie - better curl
- entr - run arbitrary commands when files change
- procs - Modern replacement for `ps`
	- `procs "$1" --no-header | awk -F 'â”‚' '{printf $1}{printf "â”‚"}{print $3}' | gum choose --no-limit | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9`
- sd - intuitive find & replace (better `sed`)
- mult - run a command multiple times and glance at the outputs
	- Usually for flakey tests

### Disk Management

- dua-cli - view disk space usage and delete unwanted data, fast
	- Run `dua i` for interactive mode
- dust - more intuitive version of du in rust
- kondo - save disk space by cleaning non-essential files from software projects

### JSON

- **jnv** - JSON navigator and interactive filter leveraging jq
	- Probably the best of the bunch ðŸ‘‘
- gojq - Pure go implementation of jq
- fx - terminal JSON viewer
- jless - command-line pager for JSON data
- jqp - a TUI playground to experiment and play with jq

### Logs

- humanlog - pretty print and tail logs
- tl (toolong) - a TUI to view, tail, merge, and search log files

### Network

- openapi-tui - terminal UI to list, browse and run APIs defined with OpenAPI

### LLM

- [mods](https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods) - AI on the command line
- [tlm](https://github.com/yusufcanb/tlm) - terminal copilot, powered by CodeLLaMa.

### Golang

- [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) - live reload for Go apps
- [gowatch](https://github.com/silenceper/gowatch) - watcher for go app that restarts the app when you save a file
	- e.g. when developing my CLI tool: `gowatch --args='--pr=https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27082'`
