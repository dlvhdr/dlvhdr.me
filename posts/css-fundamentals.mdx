preface: "I was asked to do a session about CSS for new grads who just joined our team. This is my view on the most important concepts in CSS for beginners."
---

My team recently recruited 6 new grads.
As part of their onboarding they were going to tackle CSS.
I wanted to give them my take on what's important to know in CSS.

###### These concepts are what I think is most important:
- Specificity
- Cascading
- The box model
- The `display` property
- The `position` property
- Flexbox
- Pseudo classes
- CSS Variables

Finally, I will add some more *"flashy"* concepts and list off my resources.

### Basic Syntax

Let's lay the basics.
This is the basic CSS syntax:

```css
selector { rule: value }
```

This applies the rules written in the curly braces to all elements that match the selector.

### Specificity

Each selector gets a specificity score which determines the priority it gets compared to other selectors.

As each element can be affected by several selectors, each with possibly different values for the same rule, we need to determine what takes precedence.

Imagine we have this element on the screen: `<div class="some-class"></div>`

Given the CSS below - the element's `background-color` would be red:

```css
div {
  background-color: blue;
}

.some-class {
  background-color: red;
}

```

**The score is represented in three categories:**

**ID**, **Classes**, **Tags**

- When a selector uses an ID, it gets 1 point in the ID category (`#some-id`) - 1,0,0
- When a selector uses a class, it gets 1 point in the class category (`.some-class`) - 0,1,0
- When a selector uses a tag, it gets 1 point in the tag category (`div`) - 0,0,1

Then when comparing selectors, we first start comparing by the ID category, and if it’s equal, we go over to the classes category etc.
So, if an element is targeted by an ID selector, and another selector only uses classes and tags, it will **never** override the rules used in the ID selector.

### Cascading

Some properties are cascaded down.

Meaning if you set the `color` prop on the body, each of the HTML elements under the body tag will get this `color` value.

```css
body {
	color: blue;
}
```

The value that will be applied will be the one which was declared last.

If you want to use an escape hatch to better control what is inherited, you can use:

```css
color: unset; 
```

### Box Model

![Box Model](/images/css-fundamentals/box-model.png)

Each **block** element is modeled as a box.<br/>
Each box is defined by its content, padding, border and margins.

The dimensions of the box is determined by all of these.

Does this model means everything in CSS is boxes?<br />
How can we draw triangles?<br />
Also, what happens when two or more borders overlap?

Here's a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/JjrVZow) that shows how to utilize this in order to draw a **triangle**.

Try setting one of the border's color to `transparent`.

##### box-sizing

To change which of the box parts are taken into account when calculating the dimentions, you can use `box-sizing`.
Its value can be `border-box` (which is the default) and `content-box`

By default in the [CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model), the `width` and `height` you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content box. If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the `width` and `height` to arrive at the size of the box that's rendered on the screen. 
But when you set `box-sizing` to `border-box` the width will constrain the `content`, `padding` and `border`.

`border-box` is a lot more intuitive as a default value, that's why a lot of people include this CSS reset rule:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Display

In CSS, each element is either a block or an inline element (with some exceptions).<br />

**Block** elements push sibling elements to the next line.

**Inline** elements, well, don't.<br />
Also, you cannot set their width or height.<br />
They simply wrap their content.

The `display` property controls that.

```css
/**
 * The element generates a block element box, 
 * generating line breaks both before and after
 * the element when in the normal flow.
 */
display: block;

/** 
 * The element generates one or more inline
 * element boxes that do not generate line
 * breaks before or after themselves.
 */
display: inline;

/** 
 * The element generates a block element
 * box that will be flowed with surrounding
 * content as if it were a single inline box.
 */
display: inline-block;

/**
 * Hide the element completely
 */
display: none;
```

### Positioning

This positioning technique is useful when positioning elements outside of the usual flow of the document.<br />
The usual flow is where block elements appear in the order of where they appear in the HTML document.<br />
This takes into account that `block` elements like `div` push elements below them, while `inline` elements don't.

But sometimes you want to break that flow, and position an element otherwise.
This property allows you to do just that.

```css
position: static;
position: relative;
position: absolute;
position: fixed;
position: sticky;
```

**`static`**

The regular position of an element according to the flow of the document.

**`relative`**

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset *relative to itself* based on the values of: 
`top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

**`absolute`**

The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its **closest positioned ancestor (anything other than static)** if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the body.

Its final position is determined by the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

**`fixed`**

The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the body.

Its final position is determined by the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

```html
<div class="container">
</div>
<div class="some-element">
  Content
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  height:1000px;
  width: 200px;
  border: 10px solid pink;
  background: blue;
  margin: 20px;
}

.some-element {
  height: 20px;
  width: 20px;
  background: red;
  margin: 20px;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
}
```

**`sticky`**

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its *nearest scrolling ancestor* and [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) (nearest block-level ancestor).

```css
body {
  overflow: auto;
}
```

### Flexbox

Flexbox is your best friend when writing CSS.
I do **99%** of the positining on screen using it.

Unlike the position property, `flexbox` doesn't remove elements from the flow of the document, but rather re-arranges them within the `flexbox` container.
The elements in that container will still push elements outside it and interact with them.

There are a ton of `flexbox` resources that will do a better job that I will, so here they are:

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- [Flexbox defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/)

### CSS Variables

You can set variables in CSS.<br />
Each variable can be referenced in elements that are a child of the one its defined in.

In order for them be global, you can use the :root selector.

```css
:root {
  --my-color: pink;
  --animation-speed: 0.3s;
}

.some-class {
  --my-color: blue;
  color: var(--my-color);
  animation: some-animation var(--animation-speed) 
}
```

### Pseudo Elements

Not every element on a page needs to be defined in the HTML.

For things that are used mainly for representational purposes, you can use pseudo elements:
here's a [Codpen example](https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/YzrMvqK).

```css
div::before {
	content: "";
	display: block;
}

div::after {
	/* ... */
}
```

Besides `::before` and `::after`, there are many more, like the `::marker` element which is responsible for displaying the `·` in unordered lists (`ul`). <br />
Read more about them in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements).

The rest of this, are just things to make you want to learn more CSS.

### Animations

There are 2 ways to animate in CSS.

[https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/eYGoRJq](https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/eYGoRJq)

1. The `transition` property
2. Using the `animation` property which gives you finer control over the steps

### Media queries

In order to have your website display well on all kinds of devices, you should use media queries.

Of course there are more use cases like setting the preferred color scheme (light or dark) and reducing animations for people who prefer to have them reduced.

[https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/RwLOydX](https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/RwLOydX)

Basic syntax, where media-type can be:

- `all`
- `print`
- `screen`

```css
@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
  /* CSS rules go here */
}
```

### Programming with CSS

You can even use CSS to add behavior, instead of Javascript.

CSS checkboxes can be [used for state](https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/JjrVvaB?editors=1100)

```css
  input[type=checkbox]:checked {
    ...
  }
```
    
Pseudo classes can be used to add even [more functionality](https://codepen.io/dlvhdr/pen/MWERGVp).
